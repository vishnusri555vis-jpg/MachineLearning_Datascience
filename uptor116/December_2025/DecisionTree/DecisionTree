DecisionTree

Decision Tree is called Non Parametric Model. Supervised Learning

2 Kinds of Model:

1. Parametric:
    Just with assumption above the data and its relationship with col
    Ex: Linear Regression

2. Non Parametric:
    Just with assumption above the data and its relationship with col
    and also considering the rows (no of rows)
    Ex: Decision Tree

Decision Tree:
1. It is meant for non-linear data, but can be used in linear also
2. It is for both Classification and Regession
3. Any model that work for both is called 'cart' model
4. This is going to predict data based on the Tree structure
    - Based on columns(node) tree is formed
    - Out of all column, 1 node will be chosen as parent node
    - Target will be final leaf element
    - Node is x data, leaf is y data

5.Parameters of decision tree:
1. Parent Node:
Parent node is based on 2 parameters and this process is called as "criterion"
    1. Gini InPurity(Default chosen)
    2. Entropy
Parent node will be selected based on any of the 2 metrics and its "Information Gain"
Which col has more value will be selected

2.Max Depth
3.Min Sample Leaf
4.Min Sample Split
5.n_jobs
